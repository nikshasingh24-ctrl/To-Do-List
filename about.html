    <p> 
      This is a simple To-do list application. It allows users to add, delete, mark tasks and remove all tasks at once.
      Through this project i was able to learn:
      <ul>
        <li>use basic html tags</li>
        <li>create and remove elements using javascript</li>
        <li>create functions using javascript</li>
        <li>append items in lists using javascript</li>
      
        
      <p>
        
        I tried exploring local storage so that the tasks can be saved although i am not fully confident in it yet. I am still learning web development
        so I focused more on html and js. Working on this project taught me a lot about how html interacts with js. I focused mainly on the functionality 
        so I couldnt spend time learning css. My next goal is to further strengthen javascript as well as learn css to make web pages more polished.
